| ------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| [Netflix Project](https://github.com/puskr/netflix_project) <br> ![Netflix Project](https://github.com/puskr/netflix_project/blob/main/Netflix_2015_logo.svg.png) | The "Netflix Project" is a YouTube tutorial demonstrating how to analyze and manipulate Netflix data using PostgreSQL. I answered 15 questions, covering various SQL concepts and techniques to help viewers effectively query and work with data in a PostgreSQL environment. | SQL |
| [5 Dashboards](https://github.com/puskr/Data-Analytics-Assessment-3rd-Sem/tree/main) <br> ![5 Dashboards](https://github.com/puskr/Data-Analytics-Assessment-3rd-Sem/blob/main/CUSTOMER%20DASHBOARD.png) | This project showcases five interactive dashboards created using Power BI as part of my Data Analytics assessment for the 3rd semester of my MBIS program. The dashboards highlight key insights and visualizations derived from data analysis, demonstrating my analytical skills and understanding of data-driven decision-making. | Power BI |
| [Coffee Sales](https://github.com/puskr/Coffee-Sales-Project) <br> ![Coffee Sales Project](https://github.com/puskr/Coffee-Sales-Project/blob/main/coffee-background-coffee-beans-pause-preview.jpg) | In this project, I analyze coffee sales data to uncover trends and insights that drive business decisions. | Power BI, SQL |
| [Australian Vehicle Price](https://github.com/puskr/Australian-Vehicle-Price-Project) <br> ![Australian Vehicle Price Project](https://github.com/puskr/Australian-Vehicle-Price-Project/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-10-03%20143341.png) | This project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle. I answered the following questions: <br> 1. What are the top 5 most expensive vehicles in the dataset? <br> 2. How many vehicles are listed in each state? <br> 3. List all vehicles with a mileage greater than 100,000 km. <br> 4. What are the distinct brands in the dataset? <br> 5. Retrieve the average price of vehicles based on their transmission type. <br> 6. Find the average price of vehicles for each fuel type. <br> 7. List the top 10 most common vehicle models. <br> 8. What is the correlation between mileage and price for each brand? <br> 9. Show the price distribution for vehicles manufactured in each year. <br> 10. Count the number of vehicles by year and state, and list the top 3 years with the highest counts. <br> 11. Create a subquery to find the average price of vehicles for each brand and compare it to the overall average price. <br> 12. Identify any outliers in vehicle prices using a statistical method (e.g., Z-score). <br> 13. Write a query to calculate the percentage change in vehicle prices year-over-year. <br> 14. Use window functions to determine the rank of each vehicle model by price within its fuel type. | SQL, Python |
| [Customer Churn Analysis](https://github.com/puskr/Customer-Churn-Analysis) <br> ![Customer Churn Analysis](https://github.com/puskr/Customer-Churn-Analysis/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-10-04%20102831.png) | This is a YouTube tutorial - "Python Project For Data Analysis- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) End-to-End Project." It employs Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization. The analysis includes exploring customer demographics (e.g., gender and senior citizen status), contract types, and payment methods and visualizing churn rates through various plots like count plots, pie charts, and stacked bar charts. Key insights are drawn from the visualizations to understand patterns and factors influencing customer retention, helping identify improvement areas in service offerings. | Python |
| [Monday Coffee Sales Analysis](https://github.com/puskr/monday_coffee) <br> ![Monday Coffee Sales Analysis](https://github.com/puskr/monday_coffee/blob/main/coffee-background-coffee-beans-pause-preview.jpg) | This is a YouTube tutorial titled "Data Analyst SQL Project Beginners Solve Real Business Problems PostgreSQL, by Zero Analyst" which provides a detailed, hands-on approach to utilizing PostgreSQL for data management and analysis. The project covers essential SQL concepts, including table creation, data manipulation, and querying techniques. It emphasizes using aggregate functions, joins, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to analyze datasets effectively. | SQL |
| [Spotify Data Analysis](https://github.com/puskr/spotify-data-analysis) <br> ![Spotify Data Analysis](https://github.com/puskr/spotify-data-analysis/blob/main/Spotify-logo.webp) | This is a YouTube tutorial titled "Spotify Data Analysis Using SQL (Guided), by Zero Analyst" solving the following problems: <br> **Easy Level**: <br> 1. Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams. <br> 2. List all albums along with their respective artists. <br> 3. Get the total number of comments for tracks where licensed = TRUE. <br> 4. Find all tracks that belong to the album type single. <br> 5. Count the total number of tracks by each artist. <br> **Medium Level**: <br> 1. Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album. <br> 2. Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values. <br> 3. List all tracks along with their views and likes where official_video = TRUE. <br> 4. For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks. <br> 5. Retrieve the track names that have been streamed on Spotify more than YouTube. <br> **Advanced Level**: <br> 1. Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions. <br> 2. Write a query to find tracks where the liveness score is above the average. <br> 3. Use a WITH clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album. <br> 4. Find tracks where the energy-to-liveness ratio is greater than 1.2. <br> 5. Calculate the cumulative sum of likes for tracks ordered by the number of views, using window functions. | SQL |
| [Walmart Sales Data Analysis](https://github.com/puskr/walmart-Sales-Data-Analysis) <br> ![Walmart Sales Data Analysis](https://github.com/puskr/walmart-Sales-Data-Analysis/blob/main/1723730001228.webp) | This is a YouTube tutorial titled "End-to-End Data Analyst Project for Beginners: Walmart Sales Data Analysis with SQL & Python", by Zero Analyst, solving the following problems: <br> 1. find different payment method and number of transactions, number of qty sold. <br> 2.
